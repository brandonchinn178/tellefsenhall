<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Since 1960, TH has been home to members of the University of California Marching Band, providing a unique, fun-filled atmosphere of camaraderie and activity ever since.</p>

<p>We offer a unique living experience that you can’t get anywhere else on campus. Our housing options are $4000 cheaper than the average dorm. We have our own full time chef, cleaning staff, and Board of Directors that ensure your experience at TH will be a positive one. Everyone in the house is a member of the Cal Band, so you’ll be living with the people you practice and perform with. It’s a great community of bandsmen at an affordable price.</p>
